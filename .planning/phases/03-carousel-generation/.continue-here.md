</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Context gathering (discuss-phase): Done — 03-CONTEXT.md captures user decisions on wizard flow, template grid, style cards, slide navigation, post body placement, action bar, and success screen
- Research: Done — 03-RESEARCH.md covers async job patterns, atomic credit deduction, client-side ZIP, webhook HMAC verification, polling with exponential backoff
- Planning: Done — 7 plans created (03-01 through 03-07) in 5 waves
- Plan verification: Done — all 32 requirement IDs covered, all context decisions honored
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Plan 03-02 (Wave 2): Backend APIs (generation action, N8N webhooks, status polling) — Not started
- Plan 03-03 (Wave 3): Generation wizard UI (3-step form) — Not started
- Plan 03-04 (Wave 3): Carousel viewer, polling, ZIP download, success screen — Not started

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Stepped wizard flow: Idea → Template → Style → Generate (user choice)
- Structured idea input with separate fields for topic, key points, tone (user choice)
- Visual grid for template selection showing all 5-6 options at once (user choice)
- Style cards with visual previews for 4 presets + custom option (user choice)
- Slide-by-slide navigation with arrows + thumbnail strip below (user choice)
- Post body text displayed below slide viewer, clearly separated (user choice)
- Download ZIP and Regenerate buttons in action bar below post body text (user choice)
- Brief success screen ("Your carousel is ready!") before viewing result (user choice)
- Wait experience, history layout, loading/error states left to Claude's discretion
- JSZip for client-side ZIP generation (research recommendation)
- HMAC-SHA256 for webhook verification (research recommendation)
- Exponential backoff polling 2s→4s→8s (research recommendation)
- Traditional page-based pagination for history (20/page) (research recommendation)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- N8N_WEBHOOK_URL and N8N_WEBHOOK_SECRET env vars will be needed for Plan 03-02 (backend APIs). User will need to configure these from their N8N workflow.

<context>
Phase 3 is the core feature of the SaaS — carousel generation. It's the biggest phase so far with 32 requirements spanning generation (GEN), history (HIST), N8N integration (N8N), and UI. The wave structure builds foundation first (schema/types), then backend APIs, then parallel frontend work (wizard + viewer), then history + nav, and finally a verification checkpoint. Phases 1 (auth/credits) and 2 (brand management) are complete.
