# Carousel Creator SaaS

## What This Is

A SaaS platform where users create professional social media carousels (LinkedIn-focused, expandable to other platforms) by entering content ideas. The system processes these through an N8N workflow to generate branded carousel images (5-10 slides) with accompanying post body text. Users manage their brand identity, select from template designs and image styles, then download their generated carousels. Monetized through Stripe subscriptions with a credit-based usage system.

## Core Value

Non-designers can quickly create professional, branded LinkedIn carousels that match their voice and visual identity, without needing design skills or tools.

**Frontend & Design**
- [ ] Landing page with hero section and signup CTA (light theme, minimalist, relume.io inspired)

- [ ] Dashboard displays historical carousels
- [ ] Dashboard includes brand settings page
- [ ] Dashboard includes account/subscription management
- [ ] All pages use light theme only (no dark mode)
- [ ] Design built using frontend-design-skill

**Deployment & Infrastructure**
- [ ] Application deployed to Vercel
- [ ] Version control managed via GitHub
- [ ] Supabase configured for authentication and database
- [ ] Stripe configured with production webhooks

### Out of Scope

- **Dark mode** — Light theme only for v1, keeps design simple and aligned with relume.io inspiration
- **Multiple brands per user** — One brand per user in v1, can expand later if needed
- **Social media publishing** — Users download carousels manually, no direct posting to LinkedIn/other platforms
- **Template creation UI** — Templates provided via external URLs, no in-app template builder
- **Real-time collaboration** — Single user carousel creation, no multi-user editing
- **Mobile app** — Web-first for v1, mobile can come later
- **Video carousels** — Static images only, video adds complexity and cost
- **In-app editing** — Carousels generated by N8N are final, users regenerate if changes needed
- **White-label / multi-tenant brands** — Each user account = one brand, not an agency tool in v1
- **Usage analytics** — No tracking of carousel performance on social platforms

## Context

**Existing N8N Workflow:**
The carousel generation workflow already exists and is operational. It currently stores outputs in Airtable and images on ImageB (free hosting). This workflow needs to be updated to integrate with Supabase instead of Airtable, but the core generation logic is proven and working.

**Template Assets:**
The 5-6 carousel templates (front page, content pages, CTA page) will be provided as external URLs. Each template is a multi-page design that the N8N workflow uses to generate consistent carousel layouts. Templates are hosted externally and referenced by URL.

**Image Hosting:**
ImageB handles all carousel image hosting through the N8N workflow. This is already working and requires no changes. The workflow returns URLs to images stored on ImageB.

**Design Inspiration:**
The relume.io website provides the design reference: clean, minimalist, light theme, professional animations, clear hierarchy. The frontend-design-skill will be used to implement this aesthetic.

**Credit Economics:**
- Free tier: 3 carousels total (lifetime trial to experience the product)
- Paid tier: $29.99/month base provides 10 credits/month
- Each carousel generation = 1 credit
- Regenerating costs another credit
- Credits roll over month-to-month (encourages annual retention)
- Typical carousel: 5-10 slides

**Brownfield Context:**
Repository contains GSD workflow scaffolding but no application code yet. Codebase mapping completed, ready for greenfield development within existing GSD structure.

## Constraints

- **Tech Stack**: Must use Supabase (auth + database), Stripe (payments), N8N (carousel generation), Vercel (hosting), Next.js/React (frontend)
- **N8N Workflow**: Existing workflow must be preserved and updated (not rebuilt from scratch) — only change storage from Airtable to Supabase
- **Template Hosting**: Templates hosted externally, provided as URLs — we store references, not files
- **Image Hosting**: ImageB via N8N (already working) — we receive URLs, not files
- **Design**: Light theme only, minimalist aesthetic inspired by relume.io
- **Brand Model**: One brand per user account in v1 (architectural simplification)
- **MCP Integration**: Must use N8N-MCP GitHub repository for N8N integration
- **Frontend Skill**: Must use frontend-design-skill for UI implementation

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Supabase for auth + database | Integrated solution simpler than separate services, good developer experience | — Pending |
| N8N external workflow | Already built and working, powerful generation capabilities, just needs Supabase integration | — Pending |
| One brand per user | Simplifies v1 data model and UX, can expand to multi-brand later if needed | — Pending |
| Credits deducted on generation | Prevents abuse (generate hundreds without downloading), makes cost clear to user | — Pending |
| Auto-save all carousels | Provides user history without manual save decision, enables reference library | — Pending |
| Light theme only | Matches relume.io inspiration, reduces design complexity, ships faster | — Pending |
| Free tier: 3 lifetime | Provides meaningful trial experience while limiting abuse, encourages upgrade | — Pending |
| Credit rollover for paid | Encourages retention, fair to users who pay but don't use all credits each month | — Pending |
| Template URLs external | Simplifies infrastructure, user provides hosted templates, we just reference them | — Pending |
| Download as zip | Convenient package for all slides, users can extract and upload to LinkedIn manually | — Pending |
