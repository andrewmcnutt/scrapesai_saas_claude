## Notes

This is an application scaffold with no external integrations yet configured. The project is initialized with the GSD framework for development assistance but contains no application-specific API connections, databases, or services.

To add integrations as the project develops:
1. Create `src/` directory structure for application code
2. Add package.json with required dependencies
3. Configure environment variables for external services
4. Document integration endpoints and authentication methods
