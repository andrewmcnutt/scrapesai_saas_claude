# Architecture

**Analysis Date:** 2026-02-21

## Pattern Overview

**Overall:** No application codebase detected

**Key Characteristics:**
- Empty repository with no source code
- Only GSD (get-shit-done) tool infrastructure present
- No application logic, layers, or business logic implemented
- Repository is initialized for future development

## Repository State

**Status:** Empty/Initialization Phase

This repository contains only:
- `.claude/` - GSD tool configuration and templates
- `.git/` - Git repository metadata
- `.planning/` - Planning and documentation directory (this file)

**Application Code:** Not detected

No source directories (`src/`, `lib/`, `app/`, `components/`, etc.) found. No language-specific entry points or frameworks detected.

## Intended Use

Based on repository structure, this appears to be:
- A placeholder for future SaaS application development
- Configured to use GSD workflow management system
- Ready to begin implementation planning and tracking

## Next Steps for Setup

When application code is added, the architecture will need to be re-analyzed for:
- Framework selection (React, Vue, Node.js, Python, etc.)
- Layer structure (API, business logic, UI)
- Data flow patterns
- Module organization
- Error handling strategy
